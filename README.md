# CJ_Mobility_Visualization
Visualization of Central Jersey mobility flows (Python code under Jupyter Notebook)

A Transportation Task has been initiated by the Princeton Municipality with some volunteers.
The task is to understand the mobility flows of people inside and outside of municipalities
from Central Jersey, in order to support municipalities in the update of the regional
transportation plan.

Work has been initiated from Census data under Excel, mainly by using pivot tables. Idea is
to continue the work with Python in order to build more attractive and dynamic visualization
animations for local deciders.

Sets of files

1. All commuters in and out of Central Jersey
   - DataCJflows.xlsx = genuine working file with all data and pivot tables
   - DataCJflowsIN.csv = data file for all IN-commuters
   - DataCJflowsOUT.csv = date file for all OUT-commuters
   - DataCJflows_Pivot_Table.ipynb = notebook for loading data and creating pivot table

2. Modelling of circulation flows on Route 1 in Central Jersey
   - Route1Analysis.xlsx = genuine working file with all data and calculations
   - Route1Analysis.csv = data file for all CJ commuters crossing, avoiding or using Route 1
   - Route1AnalysisCalculations.ipynb = notebook for loading data, creating pivot tables and analyzing data (under progress)
