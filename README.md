# CJ_Mobility_Visualization
Visualization of Central Jersey mobility flows (Python code under Jupyter Notebook)

A Transportation Task has been initiated by the Princeton Municipality with some volunteers.
The task is to understand the mobility flows of people inside and outside of municipalities
from Central Jersey, in order to support municipalities in the update of the regional
transportation plan.

Work has been initiated from Census data under Excel, mainly by using pivot tables. Idea is
to continue the work with Python in order to build more attractive and dynamic visualization
animations for local deciders.

   - DataCJflowsIN.csv = data file for all IN-commuters
   - DataCJflowsOUT.csv = date file for all OUT-commuters
   - DataCJflows_Pivot_Table.ipynb = notebook for loading data and creating pivot table
